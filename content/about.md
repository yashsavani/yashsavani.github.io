## About Me

Hi! I am a research scientist, mathematician, and engineer with a passion for exploration and learning.
The pervasive puzzles and patterns of our interconnected lives fascinate me, and I aspire to exercise my repertoire of
math, computation, and collaboration skills to solve those puzzles with the highest positive societal impact.
My current research interests include statistical learning theory, optimization theory, and deep learning.

## Experience

- Research Scientist\
    [Abacus.AI](https://abacus.ai/) (fka RealityEngines.AI) | San Francisco, CA | May 2020 - May 2021\
    I conducted research in the AutoML / Neural Architecture Search and Fairness in ML domains. We wrote five papers based on this work.
- Machine Learning Engineer\
    [Abacus.AI](https://abacus.ai/) (fka RealityEngines.AI) | San Francisco, CA | Apr 2020 - May 2020\
    I designed and implemented scalable deep learning systems for LSTM-based time-series forecasting, AutoML / neural architecture search for regression and classification, GAN-based data augmentation, and VAE-based anomaly detection among others.
- Machine Learning Engineer\
    [Primer Technologies, Inc.](https://primer.ai/) | San Francisco, CA | Aug 2017 - Dec 2018\
- Research Intern\
    Andrew Ng's Artificial Intelligence Lab | Stanford , CA | Jul 2015 - Sep 2015\
- Cofounder (CTO)\
    Ebotic | Palo Alto, CA | Jul 2014 - Dec 2015\
    I worked with an international team to develop an intelligent drone platform that applied advanced flight technologies, SLAM, and deep learning for improved flight stability and awareness.
- Research Intern\
    Sebastian Thrun's Artificial Intelligence Lab | Stanford , CA | Jun 2014 - Aug 2014\
