statement: "Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University supervised by Prof. Zico Kolter.
I am broadly interested in all aspects of machine learning, both theoretical and applied.
I have four years of industry experience operationalizing contemporary machine learning research for real-world applications.
This experience has highlighted several potentially valuable research opportunities and holes in the literature, some of which I am currently exploring.
My current research interests are robust deep learning, distributional shift, and adversarial learning."
