statement: "I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **Carnegie Mellon University**, where I work with **[Prof. Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com)** on steering **frontier generative AI models** toward greater **safety, robustness**, and **efficiency**. I work at the intersection of theoretical insight and practical scalability. My research connects the mathematics of **high-dimensional learning** (differential geometry, stochastic differential equations, optimal transport) with methods for **training** and **steering** generative models (spanning pretraining, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and controlled decoding), and brings these ideas to life at scale using **PyTorch, JAX, CUDA, Triton** and modern **distributed systems** (DeepSpeed, FSDP, Megatron)."
